## Detailed Program Execution Guide

### 1. OpenMP Programs

#### BFS/DFS Implementation (`bfs_dfs_omp.cpp`)
**Purpose**: Implements parallel Breadth-First Search and Depth-First Search algorithms for graph traversal.

**Compilation**:
```bash
g++ -fopenmp bfs_dfs_omp.cpp -o bfs_dfs_omp
```

**Execution**:
```bash
./bfs_dfs_omp
```

**Sample Input**:
```
Enter the number of vertices: 5
Enter the number of edges: 4
Enter the edges (src dest):
0 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Parallel BFS:
Visited: 0
Visited: 1
Visited: 2
Visited: 3
Visited: 4

Parallel DFS:
Visited: 0
Visited: 1
Visited: 2
Visited: 3
Visited: 4
```

**Explanation**:
- The program creates an undirected graph with the specified number of vertices and edges
- BFS traverses the graph level by level, visiting all neighbors of the current vertex before moving deeper
- DFS traverses the graph by going as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking
- Both algorithms use OpenMP for parallel processing of neighbor exploration

#### Sorting Implementation (`sorting.cpp`)
**Purpose**: Demonstrates parallel sorting algorithms and compares their performance.

**Compilation**:
```bash
g++ -fopenmp sorting.cpp -o sorting
```

**Execution**:
```bash
./sorting
```

**Sample Input**: The program generates a random array of 10,000 integers.

**Sample Output**:
```
Original vector:
[Random numbers between 0-9999]

Sequential Bubble Sort: 2.345 seconds

Parallel Merge Sort: 0.567 seconds
```

**Explanation**:
- The program implements both sequential bubble sort and parallel merge sort
- Bubble sort is used as a baseline for comparison
- Merge sort uses OpenMP sections for parallel processing of subarrays
- The output shows the time taken by each algorithm

#### Min-Max Implementation (`min_max.cpp`)
**Purpose**: Finds minimum and maximum values in an array using parallel processing.

**Compilation**:
```bash
g++ -fopenmp min_max.cpp -o min_max
```

**Execution**:
```bash
./min_max
```

**Sample Input**: The program generates a random array of integers.

**Sample Output**:
```
Array size: 1000000
Minimum value: 1
Maximum value: 999999
Time taken: 0.123 seconds
```

**Explanation**:
- Uses OpenMP parallel reduction to find min and max values
- Divides the array into chunks for parallel processing
- Combines results using reduction operations

### 2. CUDA Programs

#### Matrix Multiplication and Vector Addition (`cuda.cu`)
**Purpose**: Demonstrates CUDA parallel processing with matrix multiplication and vector addition.

**Compilation**:
```bash
nvcc cuda.cu -o cuda_program
```

**Execution**:
```bash
./cuda_program
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Matrix Multiplication Result (first 10x10 elements):
[Matrix values will be displayed here]

Vector Addition Result (first 10 elements):
[Vector values will be displayed here]
```

**Explanation**:
- Matrix multiplication uses CUDA blocks and threads for parallel computation
- Vector addition demonstrates basic CUDA parallel processing
- Both operations are optimized for GPU execution

Test accuracy: 85.2%
```

**Explanation**:
- Uses Keras to build a neural network for sentiment analysis
- Processes text data using word embeddings
- Trains on IMDB movie review dataset
- Outputs accuracy metrics for both training and test sets

#### Boston Housing Price Prediction (`boston.py`)
**Purpose**: Predicts house prices using the Boston Housing dataset.

**Execution**:
```bash
python boston.py
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Mean Squared Error: 21.345
R2 Score: 0.789
```

**Explanation**:
- Uses regression models to predict house prices
- Features include various housing attributes
- Outputs performance metrics (MSE and RÂ² score)

#### Fashion MNIST Classification (`Fashion.py`)
**Purpose**: Classifies fashion items using the Fashion MNIST dataset.

**Execution**:
```bash
python Fashion.py
```

**Sample Output**:
```
Test accuracy: 91.2%
```

**Explanation**:
